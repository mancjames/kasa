# Project 10 - Kasa

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The purpose of this project was to create a fictional letting agency web application using React and React Router.

From this project I learnt the following:

Creating a webapplication based on a figma design, ensuring it was usable on both mobile and desktop
Create a gallery component with a photo scrolling functionality
Use React Router for the different pages, including a 404 error page when an incorrect address is used
Learn about React Hooks, such as useState and useEffect, and props.
Use JSON Data to imitate the the backend
